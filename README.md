## What we've done

### First day:
- Wrote everything we needed to do collaboratively on a HACKMD and then transferred into the project board each as small issues
- Gave estimation labels to each issue, adding actual labels as each issue is completed
- Keeping stretch goals out of the project board until we have a picture of what MVP we can achieve in the time given 
- As we go along we will be assigning ourselves to the issues we want to focus on, splitting the pairs this way
- Mobbed deploying on Heroku as a whole team
- Wrote HTML file structure in pairs
- Mobbed creating our servers as a whole team

### Second day:
- Mobbed finishing the server
- Split into pairs for first half of day
